# üîê Password Change Feature

## Overview
Added a complete password change functionality to the AquaSense dashboard that allows users to securely update their passwords after logging in.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Interface
- **Settings Button**: Added a "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" button in the user info section
- **Modern Modal**: Professional modal dialog for password change
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages with color coding

### 2. Security Features
- **Current Password Validation**: Users must enter current password to change it
- **Password Confirmation**: New password must be entered twice
- **Minimum Length**: 6-character minimum requirement
- **Secure Storage**: Passwords stored in browser's localStorage

### 3. User Experience
- **Easy Access**: One-click access from dashboard sidebar
- **Clear Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Smooth Animations**: Modal slides in with professional animations
- **Auto-close**: Modal closes automatically after successful change

## How It Works

### Step 1: Access Settings
- User clicks "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" button in the sidebar
- Password change modal opens

### Step 2: Change Password
1. Enter current password for verification
2. Enter new password (minimum 6 characters)
3. Confirm new password
4. Click "Change Password"

### Step 3: Validation
- Verifies current password is correct
- Ensures new passwords match
- Checks minimum length requirements
- Shows success/error messages

### Step 4: Storage
- New password saved to browser's localStorage
- Login system updated to check custom passwords
- User can immediately use new password

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- **Modal HTML**: Professional form with validation
- **CSS Styling**: Modern design with animations
- **JavaScript Logic**: Password validation and storage

### Password Management
- **Default Credentials**: 
  - admin / admin123
  - operator / operator123
- **Custom Storage**: New passwords override defaults
- **Fallback System**: Always checks custom passwords first

### Security Notes
- Passwords stored locally in browser
- No server-side authentication (demo system)
- For production: implement server-side password hashing

## File Changes

### 1. `/public/index.html`
- Added settings button to sidebar
- Added password change modal HTML
- Added modal CSS styling
- Added JavaScript functions for password management

### 2. `/public/login.html`
- Updated login validation to check custom passwords
- Maintains backward compatibility with defaults

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Log in to AquaSense dashboard
2. Click "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" in the sidebar
3. Enter current password and new password
4. Confirm the change
5. Use new password for future logins

### For Developers:
- Passwords stored in `localStorage.aquasense_credentials`
- Login system checks custom passwords first
- Easy to extend for additional security features

## Future Enhancements
- Server-side password hashing
- Password strength meter
- Password history prevention
- Account lockout protection
- Email notifications for password changes

**Security Note**: This implementation is for demonstration purposes. Production systems should use server-side authentication with proper password hashing and security measures.
